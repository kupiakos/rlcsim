rlcsim
--------

rlcsim is an arbritrary RLC (Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor) series circuit simulator.
It arose from a discussion about what would happen if static was put through an RLC circuit.


At the current moment, rlcsim is not flexible. At all.
This will be rectified eventually. Hopefully soon.
